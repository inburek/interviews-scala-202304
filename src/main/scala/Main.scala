/*
Drug Trial:
A pharmaceutical company is planning a Phase 3 double-blind trial for a new drug candidate.
In order to run the trial, the researchers need to randomly determine which of their participants will receive the drug candidate,
a placebo and who will be in the control group receiving no medication.

The researchers have decided on the following rules to be applied to the last name of the participants.
Excluding all the vowels from their name,
- if there is an odd number of remaining characters then that participant receives the placebo.

If there are no vowels in the name then the participant receives no medication at all as they are a member of the control group.

Everyone else receives the drug.

Use TDD to implement your solution.

Tasks

Create a method to determine if the participant receives the drug, placebo or neither.
